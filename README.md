# Condensed Local Differential Privacy (CLDP)

Condensed LDP (CLDP) is a formal alternative to Local Differential Privacy (LDP). In CLDP, similar outputs are systematically favored to distant outputs using condensed probability when perturbing user data. This repository contains the implementations of our CLDP protocols proposed in:

A pre-print version of the paper is [also available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06361.pdf).

## Repository Status
